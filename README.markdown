## What is the PIES Model?

The PIES model, developed by [Marriage Helper](https://marriagehelper.com/), is a framework for understanding and building attraction in relationships.

It stands for:
- **Physical Attraction**: Encompasses physical appearance, health, and expressions of affection.
- **Intellectual Attraction**: Involves shared interests, engaging conversations, and sparking intellectual curiosity.
- **Emotional Attraction**: Refers to evoking positive emotions, fostering connection, and creating emotional safety.
- **Spiritual Attraction**: Includes shared values, beliefs, and a sense of aligned purpose.

By focusing on personal growth in these four areas, individuals can enhance their attraction and strengthen their relationships.
