Didn't want to use paper, so I had Grok create a web-based version of a PIES tracker.

The PIES model, used by Marriage Helper, is a framework for understanding and building attraction in a relationship.

It stands for Physical, Intellectual, Emotional, and Spiritual attraction.

By working on yourself in these four areas, individuals can enhance their attraction and/or strengthen their relationship. 

` - Physical Attraction:
This encompasses physical appearance, health, and the physical expressions of affection. 

` - Intellectual Attraction:
This involves shared interests, engaging conversations, and the ability to spark intellectual curiosity in each other. 

` - Emotional Attraction:
This refers to the ability to evoke positive emotions in each other, creating a sense of connection and emotional safety. 

` - Spiritual Attraction:
This includes shared values, beliefs, and a sense of purpose that aligns the couple's spiritual dimensions.
